1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was for a new company offering driver training services. The client, Liam (owner of DriverPass), supported by his IT officer Ian, wanted a cloud-based, web-accessible system to manage all aspects of the business. This included customer registration, appointment scheduling, online courses, practice tests, payment processing, notifications, and administrative tools. The goal was to combine online learning with behind-the-wheel training in a secure, efficient platform
2. What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well in clearly defining functional and nonfunctional requirements. For example, requirements such as role-based access control, secure login, scheduling conflict prevention, and audit logging were captured in detail. Additionally, I translated those business needs into specific technical designs, including UML diagrams and database tables
3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the limitations section of the business requirements. While it identified budget and technical constraints, I would improve it by adding more realistic scaling considerations and future-proofing strategies. For instance, highlighting how the system could integrate DMV APIs or mobile apps in later phases would show stronger foresight.
4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted user needs by mapping client goals (like easy lesson scheduling and secure reporting) directly into the design through modules such as the scheduling system, practice test tracking, and administrative dashboards. Considering user needs is crucial because a system that doesn’t align with real workflows will fail adoption. In this case, ensuring ease of use for both customers and staff was a priority, which is why features like password resets, mobile accessibility, and role-based permissions were emphasized
5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design by starting with requirements gathering and translating them into functional requirements and use cases. From there, I create UML diagrams to visualize workflows and interactions, followed by specifying technical requirements (databases, APIs, authentication). In the future, I would also integrate user-centered design strategies, conduct usability testing early, and apply iterative development to refine the system based on feedback. This ensures the design remains practical, secure, and scalable.
